# PoeticText Generation

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a machine learning model for generating poetic text. The model is trained on a dataset containing text from Shakespearean works. This Markdown document provides an overview of the project's key components, including dataset acquisition and model training.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the "poeticText" generation model is sourced from a publicly available URL:

[Shakespearean Text Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/shakespeare.txt)

The dataset consists of text from various works of William Shakespeare. It serves as the primary source of training data for the model.

## Model Architecture

The machine learning model for generating poetic text is implemented using a deep learning architecture, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

## Input Text:
```
it will in time
win upon power and throw forth greater theme
```

## Output Text (Generated with a Temperature of 0.2):
```
it will in time
win upon power and throw forth greater themers
and the wife and the father and the fouls.

first corses:
i will nothing the father of the faither to the
true to the true to the heart to be the prince
and the father of the such an here to him,
and the wife and the world and the compless to him.

coriolanus:
what is the see the the son the life
```


In this example, we see the input text followed by the output text generated by a language model with a low temperature setting (0.2). The output exhibits creativity and a poetic quality, with repetitions and variations introduced for artistic effect. The generated text even includes character names and section headers, resembling the style of a dramatic play or a literary work.
